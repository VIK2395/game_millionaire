A player answers on 12 questions. Each question has 4 possible answers, but only one right. On first load, the app gets a config file from the database. The config type is of JSON, and it allows to put inside as many questions as you want, which makes the app scalable. Also the app is written to randomly select questions based on the score and shuffle the possible answers to make the game unpredictable.
